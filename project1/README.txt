To execute the four max subarray algorithms, the following files are required:

- maxSubarray.py
- MSS_TestProblems.py
- runTests.py

"runTests.py" reads in the data from "MSS_TestProblems.py" and calls each of the
four algorithms included in "maxSubarray.py". The output is then redirected to 
a file called "MSS_Results.txt".

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
	type into the command line (without quotes):
	
		"python runTests.py"


TO VIEW THE OUTPUT:
	open the file that was created called "MSS_Results.txt"


To run the timing code:
- run runtimes.py
